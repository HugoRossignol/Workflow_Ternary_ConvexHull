The hyperparameters are given in the HP.md file.
In the other files, the SNAP coefficients for the 5 models used are given. 
The atomic weights are given at the end of the file name in the order $w_\mathrm{Cu}$, $w_\mathrm{Ag}$, $w_\mathrm{Au}$.
In each file, the atomic species is first indicated, followed by a block with the indices of the bispectrum in the first three columns and the fitting coefficient in the fourth.
This is repeated for each species, in each file.
