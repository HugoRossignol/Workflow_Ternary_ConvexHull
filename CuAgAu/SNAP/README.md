The hyperparameters are given in the HP file.
In the other files, the SNAP coefficients for the 5 models used are given. 
The atomic weights are given at the end of the file name in the order w_Cu, w_Ag, w_Au.
The atomic species is first indicated, followed by the indices of the bispectrum in
the first three columns and the fitting coefficient in the fourth.
This is repeated for each model.
